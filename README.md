## A Birder app designed for my SWE portfolio.

App: Designed for casual birders to look at, log and learn a little bit about the birds they see. Basic functionality is to search birds, add comments/sightings and adding birds to a wishlist.

Tools: FastAPI, PostgreSQL and React.js

Over 900 North American bird species retrieved from wikipediaapi/wikimedia restful api and stored into database. Data is currently hidden. A few descriptions or pictures do not work and am working on that!
